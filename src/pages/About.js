        All over the globe Waste is generated. Most of it is left unaccounted.
        Waste Tracker aims to connect volunteers willing to clean waste to
        places where wastes have been found.
      </p>
      <p>
        People can add markers to locate places where wastes have been found.
        Volunteers can then volunteer on these places, look at the available
        volunteers on site and their contact information.
      </p>
      <p>
        This will open a whole new possible oppurtunity to connect volunteers
        and solve the wastes collected on earth
